Right on time for our site launch, we did a real world homepage takeover. 

“The Shape of Things to Come” is the cover article in the new issue of Market Leader. Can we grow household brands in the IoT? Yes, We Can. Our Head of Strategy Mike Bayler argues that enabling automated services in the home should be the focus of brand tech, rather than more data-crunching and shopper targeting. If you’re keen to get your head around this  explosive space, this is a good place to start.

We’ll be launching the full 5000 word white paper on this subject, “Machines Of Loving Grace?” for download here shortly.
