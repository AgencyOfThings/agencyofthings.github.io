		<h5 class="subhead">We help brand marketers take on new technologies...</h5>
		<p>We see that the most demanding challenge facing consumer brands is fronting up to the constant influx of new technologies. This is not a digital marketing problem. It's a wrenching cultural and commercial shift that requires very different thinking and very different partners.</p>
		<h5 class="subhead">... and we help new technologies take their brands to market.</h5>
		<p>When start-up technologies find their market sweet spot, they survive and thrive. But most of them, irrespective of their potential, still fail. We see this as a tragic waste. Just as our brand marketing clients can face down disruption, technology start-ups can face up to their markets to become powerhouse brands.</p>

		<h5 class="subhead">Can marketers and disruptors ever make sense of each other?</h5>
		<p>It's messy, this new frontier, where a global brand stands or falls, and where a technology either takes hold, or disappears without a trace.</p>
		<p>That's why we're here, for one single purpose. To get you on the front foot. And to keep you there.</p>
		<p>Think of us as your partners in Interesting Times.</p>
