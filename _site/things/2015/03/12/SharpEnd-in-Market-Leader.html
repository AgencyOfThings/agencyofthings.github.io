<p>Right on time for our site launch, we did a real world homepage takeover. </p>

<p>“The Shape of Things to Come” is the cover article in the new issue of Market Leader. Can we grow household brands in the IoT? Yes, We Can.

<p>We’ll be launching the full 5000 word white paper on this subject, “Machines Of Loving Grace?” for download here shortly. </p>
